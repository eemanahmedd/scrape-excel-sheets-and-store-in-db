A sample excel file is added in the repo. The information in the **model year** tables need to be scrapped and be stored in PostgreSQL database.

In **config.yaml**:
1. Add the path of the main excel file that needs to be scrapped.
2. Add the different types of vehicle names in their respective vehicle types.
3. Add string values that need be compared so that we can scrape only required data.
4. Finally, add database details.
